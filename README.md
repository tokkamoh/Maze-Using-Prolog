# Maze-Using-Prolog
Using depth first uniformed search algorithm write a code to solve th emaze problem (given any start and goal points)
this code is a generic one that can be used with any type of facts or any question that needs a depthFirst algorithem
first i we entered our facts (that includes all our movements)
then we start our algorithem firstly we started with the rule that will run our game 
then the rules (path) that will be used to walk on the nodes to check for the goal and if it reaches it breaks if not it continue
the code will run using this query ?- goSolveTheMAze(gateA,hall).
